Description: rmatio is a package for reading and writing Matlab MAT
             files from R, using the C MAT File I/O Library matio
             written by Christopher Hulbert
             (http://sourceforge.net/projects/matio/).
             The package contains zlib written by Jean-loup Gailly
             and Mark Adler (http://www.zlib.net/).
Copyright: The package uses the source code of matio written by
           Christopher Hulbert (http://sourceforge.net/projects/matio/)
           (License: Simplified BSD). The matio io routines have been
           adopted to use R printing and error routines. The matio
           inflate.c have been renamed to matio-inflate.c to avoid
           name collision with zlib inflate.c.
           The package uses the source code of zlib written by
           Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler (http://www.zlib.net/)
           (License: http://zlib.net/zlib_license.html).
           The ZLIB_VERSION, ZLIB_VERNUM and ZLIB_VER_SUBREVISION have
           been changed to comply with zlib license requirement.
